Quick-C is a custom designed high-level programming language that is written in C++ base coding language. 
It provides user-friendly XML type API for building computer software applications. 
Even novice developers can also use QC to easily build apps without worrying about the complexity, 
optimization methods & mathematical aspects of C++ and C# programming languages. 
QC enables even entry-level programmers to write their own programs without having to learn anything about the backend complexity of coding architecture. 
They need not to bother about the performance of scripts and the details of the algorithms.
